<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> people from other lands have crossed
the ocean to make a new home for themselves
in America. They love its freedom. They
are happy here under its kindly rule. They
suffer less from want and hunger than in the
country of their birthplace.</p>

<p>Their children are blessed with the privilege
of attending fine schools and with the right to
learn about this wonderful world, side by side
with the sons and daughters of our most
successful and wisest people.</p>

<p>Among these newer-comers to America are
the Italians, many of whom will never again
see their own country, of which they are still
so justly proud. They will tell you it is a
land of wonderful beauty; that it has sunsets
so glorious that both artists and poets try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
picture them for us again and again; that its
history is that of a strong and mighty people
who once held rule over all the civilized world;
that thousands of travellers visit its shores
every year to look upon its paintings and its
statues, for it may truly be called the art
treasure-house of the world.</p>

<p>When you meet your little Italian cousins,
with their big brown eyes and olive skins,
whether it be in school or on the street, perhaps
you will feel a little nearer and more
friendly if you turn your attention for a while
to their home, and the home of the brave and
wise Columbus who left it that he might find
for you in the far West your own loved
country, your great, grand, free America.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<h2>TESSA<br />Our Little Italian Cousin</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TESSA</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> comes babbo! There comes
babbo!" cried Tessa, as she ran down the
narrow street to meet her father, with baby
Francesca toddling after her.</p>

<p>The man was not alone,&mdash;Beppo and the
donkey were with him. They were very tired,
for it was a hard trip from the little village on
the hilltop to the great city, miles away, and
back again. The donkey was not of much
help on the homeward journey, either. Poor
little patient beast! he was getting old now,
and he felt that his day's work was done when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he had carried a load of nuts and vegetables to
Rome in the morning. But when he had
to bring Beppo back again, he felt a little bit
sulky. So it was no wonder that he stood
quite still every few minutes and did not seem
to hear his little master scold.</p>

<p>"Get up, Pietro, get up. We shall be late
to supper," Beppo would say, but the donkey
would not move till Beppo's father used the
whip. He did not strike hard enough to hurt
the poor creature, though. Oh no, the kind
man would not do that, he was too gentle.
But he must make the donkey know the whip
was there, or they would never get home.</p>

<p>When they had crossed the wide plain and
reached the foot of the hill, Beppo got down
and walked. It was too hard on Pietro to
make him carry even a little boy now.</p>

<p>They came up the narrow road slowly till
they reached the village. And just as the
sunset spread over the sky, and gave a glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
even to the stones, Tessa caught sight of
them.</p>

<p>"My darling Tessa," said her father.
"My dear little Francesca." Tired as he
was, he took the two children in his arms and
hugged them as though he had been away
many days. Yet he had left them at five
o'clock that very morning.</p>

<p>"We have good news for you, Beppo and
I," he went on.</p>

<p>Beppo laughed till the high, pointed hat
nearly fell off his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, good news," said Beppo. "You
cannot think what it is, Tessa. May I tell
her, babbo?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child," his father answered.</p>

<p>"You are to go to Rome to-morrow with
babbo and me. The great artist who buys
our fruit wants to see you. He thinks he
may want you for a model. And me, too,
Tessa, he wants me! He will put us both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a picture. Babbo said you also had long hair,
and that we look much alike.</p>

<p>"Only think, Tessa! he will pay babbo for
letting him paint us. And mother shall have
a new dress, and you shall have some red
ribbons. We will all have a feast. Say,
Tessa, is there a nice chestnut cake waiting for
our supper? I am so hungry."</p>

<p>The boy's great black eyes sparkled as he
told the story. His long hair hung down
over his shoulders, under the odd pointed hat.
He was a beautiful child. It was no wonder
the American artist wished to put him in a
picture.</p>

<p>But Tessa was beautiful, too. The artist
would not be disappointed when he saw her.
Her skin was clear, but like the colour of the
olives which grew on the old tree behind her
house. And now there was a faint pink blush
in her cheeks as she listened to Beppo's story.</p>

<p>They were very happy children, but oh, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
poor, you would think if you should visit
them in the old house where they have
always lived. It is no wonder they like best
to be outdoors.</p>

<p>The house is all of stone, and the floor is
made of bricks. It seems dark and chilly inside
after leaving the glorious sunset. The
plaster is blackened with smoke and age. In
some places it is broken away from the wall
and is falling down.</p>

<p>But there is a picture of the Christ-child
hanging over the rough table, and the children
do not think of the dingy walls. It is home,
where a loving father and mother watch over
them and guard them from harm.</p>

<p>See! the table is spread with the simple
supper. There are the cakes made from
chestnut flour mixed with olive oil, and of
which Beppo is so fond. And here is milk
from Tessa's pet goat. Beppo runs over to
the stone fountain in the middle of the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and fills a copper dish with fresh water, and
the little family sit down to their evening
meal.</p>

<p>The mother hears the good news, and claps
her hands in delight. But what shall Tessa
wear? It troubles the good soul, for Tessa
has no shoes, and both of her dresses are old
and worn.</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," says her husband,
"don't trouble yourself about that.
The artist says he does not care about the
clothes. He was much pleased with Beppo's
cloak, however. He says it will be fine
in the picture. Let Tessa wear her wide
straw hat and her old clothes; that is all he
asks."</p>

<p>"But how will she manage to travel so far?
The child has never before gone such a distance
from home," continued her mother.</p>

<p>"She is not heavy. She can sit on Pietro's
back between the panniers. I will not load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
them heavily to-morrow, and then Pietro will
not complain. And when we come home at
night, Beppo can walk, I am sure. He may
be tired, but he is a stout lad, my Beppo is.
What do you say, my boy?"</p>

<p>Beppo was sure he could get along. He
was only too glad to have Tessa's company.</p>

<p>"But think, babbo," he exclaimed, "it is
not for one day that the artist wishes us. It
is many, many, before the picture will be finished.
We can manage somehow, I am sure.
I am nearly twelve years old now, and I am
getting very strong."</p>

<p>"But what will mother do with me away all
day long?" said Tessa. "Who will take care
of the baby while she works in the garden?
And who will help her pull the weeds?"</p>

<p>"Bruno shall watch Francesca. He will let
no harm come to her, you may be sure. Besides,
she can walk alone so well now, she is
little care. As for the garden, there is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
much more to do at present. It almost takes
care of itself," said the mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bruno can be trusted," said the
father, "he is the best dog I ever knew."</p>

<p>As he heard his name spoken, the sheep-dog
came slowly out of the chimney-corner.
He wagged his tail as though he knew what
his master and mistress had been saying.
Beppo threw him his last bit of cake and
Bruno caught it on his nose, from which it
was quickly passed into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Dear old Bruno," said Tessa, "you took
care of me when I was a baby, didn't you?
Mamma, did Bruno really rock the cradle and
keep the flies off, so I could sleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my child; when I was very ill he
would watch you all day long. And when
you began to creep, he followed you about.
If you got near the edge of a step, or any
other unsafe place, he would lift you by your
dress and bring you to my side. We should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
thank the good Lord for bringing Bruno
to us."</p>

<p>The mother looked up to the picture of
Jesus and made the sign of the cross on her

<p>An hour later the whole family were sound
asleep on their hard beds.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ROME</div>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> four o'clock the next morning every
one was awake and stirring. There was much
to be done. The vegetables and fruits must
be gathered; the donkey fed and saddled;
Tessa's hair must be carefully combed and
arranged in two long braids, and the breakfast
of hard bread and olives eaten.</p>

<p>Tessa could not eat as much as usual to-day,
she was so greatly excited. Think of it!
This was to be her first trip to the great city.
Her father and Beppo had told her so much
about the wonderful sights there, and now she
was going to look at them with her own eyes.
Perhaps she would see the children of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
artist. Beppo had told her of their blue eyes
and golden hair. He called them little angels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="Donkey being led by man with two children" />
<span class="caption">&quot;BEPPO WALKED BY HER SIDE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Ah! she would like to be fair like them,
she thought, as she looked in her tiny mirror.
She did not dream how they would admire her
own sweet dark face and soft voice.</p>

<p>Now it was six o'clock and time to start.
Tessa seated herself on Pietro's back with her
legs hidden by the bags of fruit. Beppo
walked by her side, while her father went
ahead leading Pietro by a rope.</p>

<p>Although it was so early, everybody in the
village seemed to be up and doing. As she
passed along, Tessa nodded good morning to
the old women knitting or braiding straw on
the door-steps.</p>

<p>"Pietro, do be careful," she cried, as the
donkey picked his way among babies tumbling
over each other in the narrow street while the
older children played about them.</p>

<p>Our little party passed the fountain where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a group of women were doing the family washing.
Every one had a good word for Tessa,
and wished her well, for the good news of last
night had travelled from house to house.</p>

<p>The narrow streets were paved with blocks
of black lava which had once flowed red-hot
from the volcano, Vesuvius. High stone
buildings that were hundreds of years old
stood on each side. Perhaps in far-away times
they had been forts or castles, but now the
simple peasants lived in them with no thought
of the grand old days of their country.</p>

<p>For this was Italy, the land of sunny skies
and the treasure-house of the world. Look in
your geography at the map of Europe and
find the oddly shaped peninsula that stretches
downward between two seas. It looks something
like a man's boot, don't you think so?</p>

<p>Tessa doesn't know anything about the
shape of her country, however. She has never
studied geography. In fact, she can't even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
read, for she has been to school only six
months altogether.</p>

<p>The good priest in the village loves the
little girl. He has known Beppo and Tessa
ever since they were born. He has tried to
make it possible for these children to get learning,
but many things have happened to prevent
their studying.</p>

<p>One winter their father had a broken leg;
at another, their mother was sick in bed for
one whole year. When that trouble was over,
the chestnut crop was very poor, and every
one in the family had to work hard to earn
enough to save them from starving. Something
had been the matter nearly all the time,
yet they had kept cheerful and happy. A
change would come at last, if they loved the
good Lord as they should. This is what
Tessa's mother had said again and again.</p>

<p>The little girl thought of her mother's
words as she rode proudly off on the donkey.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>One of Beppo's boy friends went with them
as far as the pasture-land below the village.
He was driving a flock of goats which he must
tend during the day. It was an easy life, but
very tedious, and the boy wished he could go
to the city, too. He had been there once, to
the carnival. It was the grand time of his
life, and he loved to tell the story over and
over to his young friends.</p>

<p>At first the donkey trotted along quite
merrily. His feet were so sure that Tessa had
no fear of his stumbling, though the way at
first was steep and stony.</p>

<p>"Good Pietro," said his little rider as she
patted his head.</p>

<p>Perhaps the praise was too much for him,
for Pietro turned his head to one side and
came to a standstill. An idea seemed to have
come to him. It was time for rest and a
lunch. Look at those nice tufts of grass by
the roadside. They must not be left behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
And Pietro began to nibble, as though he had
no idea of the important business of the day.</p>

<p>Tessa coaxed and Beppo scolded, but the
donkey would not budge. It was only when
his master turned back and snapped the whip,
that he changed his mind about going forward.</p>

<p>This was only the first of many such stops
before they drew near the city that was once
the greatest in the whole world. It well deserved
the name of Rome, or "The Famous."</p>

<p>"What are those large mounds we are passing?"
Tessa asked her father as she looked
off over the Campagna.</p>

<p>"Those are tombs of men who lived ages
ago in this loved country of ours. They were
very great, and did noble deeds."</p>

<p>"But, babbo, there is a house built on one
of the mounds."</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, the people have not kept
them honoured as they should."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tessa, look at that stone water-way running
through the plain," said Beppo. "They
have told me in the city that a great ruler
built it thousands of years ago. Think of
that, Tessa. Thousands! It cost vast sums
of money, and was made to bring the water to
the city from the distant mountains. In those
days great quantities of water were used in
immense bath-houses. But see, we are passing
an inn. I wish we were rich enough to
go in and have some lunch."</p>

<p>His father heard Beppo's words. "Don't
wish for what you cannot have, my boy," he
said. "Look at that poor old man tending
his flock of sheep, and be glad you are young
and gay. That is best of all."</p>

<p>The Italians dread old age, and many of the
peasants fear death. Beppo saw the shadow
pass across his father's face, and, like a good
son, tried to make it look as cheerful as usual.</p>

<p>"You shall not grow old and bent like that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
babbo. Tessa and I will soon be able to let
you take your ease. What do you say,
sister?"</p>

<p>Tessa laughed, and answered, "Oh, yes,
babbo, your work is nearly done now, for we
are fast growing up."</p>

<p>Tessa was only nine years old, but coming to
the city to be a model made her feel as though
she were a young woman already. They now
entered the wonderful city filled with treasures.</p>

<p>It disappointed Tessa at first. The streets
were narrow and crooked, like those of her
own little village. The high stone houses
looked dark and gloomy. And there were
beggars here! They looked poorer and more
ragged than any people at home. Here was
an old blind woman holding out a plate in
which the passers-by were asked to put a piece
of money. Tessa wished she could help her,
but she was too poor herself, and the party
passed on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't tell about these places by the
outside," Beppo whispered. "Many of them
are palaces, Tessa. Just wait till we come to
our artist's house. It is grand inside, and
there is a court in the middle of the building
with fountains and statues and beautiful plants.
And back of the house&mdash;but I won't tell you
any more. You must wait till you get there.
It is very lovely."</p>

<p>At last the donkey came to a standstill in
front of a tall building. It was seven stories
high and was all of marble.</p>

<p>"You knew when to stop, little beastie,"
said his master. "You never make mistakes
of that kind, if you do like to nibble the grass
at the wrong time. Get down, Tessa, this is
where Mr. Gray lives.</p>

<p>"The artist has his studio far up at the top
of the building. You are to go there this
morning, but his family live on the fourth
piano. Good-bye, little ones. Be good children."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The father kissed them lovingly and
went away with Pietro to sell his fruit.</p>

<p>Piano, as applied to a building, means floor
in Italian. It is very common in Italy to find
very different kinds of people living on the
several floors, or pianos, of one building. In
this old palace, which Tessa and Beppo entered
for the first time, very poor and dirty families
were huddled together on the first floor with
their dogs and other pets. Yes, even the
horse of one of the families shared their home
in this fine building.</p>

<p>But overhead, on the second floor, there
lived a prince, a real live prince, with a dozen
servants to wait on him. It did not trouble
him that poor and dirty people were below
him, because the walls were high and thick,
and the floors were of marble. He did not
seem to know even that there were such
people in the world.</p>

<p>Beppo and Tessa climbed twenty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
marble steps before they came to the second
piano; and still they must keep going up, up,
up, until they reached the very top.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop," Tessa had to say more than
once. "I am quite out of breath, and then,
too, I am scared just a little bit. Beppo, do I
look all right? Do you think the artist will
take me?"</p>

<p>Then Beppo would put his arm around his
sister and comfort her with loving words.
But at last the studio was reached, and the
children, flushed and excited, knocked at the
door.</p>

<p>"My father came with us to the city to-day.
He said you wished to see us," Beppo grew
bold enough to say when a pleasant-faced
gentleman opened the door. "He will call
for us again to-night."</p>

<p>"Come in, little ones," the gentleman answered
in Italian. "I am glad you are here.
This is Beppo, I believe. I have seen you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
before. And here is the little sister. How
do you do, my child? Make yourselves quite
at home in these easy chairs."</p>

<p>While he was speaking to the children he
was thinking, "How beautiful the little girl
is! She will do finely. The two will make
a great picture. My own children must see
them."</p>

<p>Then he went on talking with Tessa. He
showed her some curiosities and she soon
forgot her bashfulness. But it was a long
day. To be sure, the children had a delicious
lunch which a servant brought up to the
studio. The kind artist insisted they should
not touch the food they had brought with
them from home.</p>

<p>But after all, it was very tiresome to sit
quite still for half an hour at a time. And
all the while the strange gentleman's eyes were
fixed on them while his hand was busy with
the brush.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is just a sketch to-day, children.
After this, I shall need only one of you at a
time. But I like to have you come together,
nevertheless. And now your work is over
for the day.</p>

<p>"Pretty hard not to move about freely,
little one, isn't it?" he said, as he patted
Tessa on the chin. Then he rang the bell
and told the servant to call his own children
up to the studio. He would not have done
this if he had not seen that his young models
were unlike many of the poor children of the
city.</p>

<p>"They are gentle and polite, if they are
peasants," he said to himself. "My wife will
be pleased, for Lucy and Arthur are lonesome
and need some playmates of their own age."</p>

<p>A moment afterward merry voices were
heard and the Gray children came skipping
into the room.</p>

<p>"They are certainly angels," Tessa said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
herself when she saw the golden curls of Lucy
and the fair, sweet faces of her brother and herself.
But she could not tell what they said,
for they spoke in a strange tongue.</p>

<p>"It is not soft like our own dear Italian,"
she whispered to Beppo. "It is hard, this
American language."</p>

<p>"They call it English, and not American,"
her brother answered. "I am going to learn
it sometime, myself."</p>

<p>The artist turned from them to his own
children. He spoke in Italian. "Lucy and
Arthur are just beginning to speak your
tongue, Tessa, but they learn fast. They
wish to know you and Beppo. I told them
you were coming. They would like to play
with you, but as yet they cannot talk much
Italian. It is an hour yet before your father
will come for you. Would you like to go
down into the garden and walk among the
flowers for a little while?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Tessa's eyes sparkled with delight, and her
heart beat quite fast when Lucy stretched out
her white hand and held fast her own brown
one.</p>

<p>"Come, Tessa and Beppo," said Arthur,
who now spoke to his young visitors for the
first time. "Come, and I will show you the
garden."</p>

<p>The four children left the studio and ran
down the great staircase. They did not stop
until they found themselves on the ground
floor. Then they passed out through a wide
doorway into the courtyard.</p>

<p>Tessa held her breath with delight.</p>

<p>"Beppo, Beppo, look at that fountain," she
cried. "And see the lovely cherub with its
wings spread."</p>

<p>Lucy understood the words and she was
pleased.</p>

<p>"The prince owns this court," she said,
"but he has told father that we may come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
here and bring our friends when we like. Let
us go into the gardens beyond."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="staircase and gardens with palace in background" />
<span class="caption">IN THE PALACE GARDEN</span>
</div>

<p>The little Italians had hardly time to notice
the statues and the beautiful plants before they
were led into the great garden.</p>

<p>Here were orange-trees loaded with the yellow
fruit. There were beds of flowers in
bloom, although it was late in November.
Beyond, were stone walls over which delicate
vines were creeping, and marble statues were
half hidden in the niches.</p>

<p>"There is a lizard," cried Arthur. "Don't
you see him creeping along that stone wall?
He's a little fellow, but, oh, my, he's quick in
his motions."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Beppo, who had forgotten
his shyness now. "I will charm him. But
you must all keep still."</p>

<p>He gave a long, low whistle. The lizard,
which had crept into a hole, raised his head
and looked toward the children in delight, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he drew himself to the top of the wall and lay
quite still.</p>

<p>Again Beppo whistled in the same way, and
the lizard crept nearer. And now he stretched
himself at length upon the walk at Beppo's
feet.</p>

<p>"I could keep him charmed like that all
day long," said the boy. "It is queer, isn't
it? Did you ever notice a lizard's feet?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? The odd way the
toes swell out on the edges?" Arthur asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. That is why the creature can walk
across the ceiling like a fly. But it isn't the
only reason, for a sticky substance oozes out,
and that helps his feet to fasten themselves.
I've seen them do it many times."</p>

<p>"I wonder how they make that queer
noise," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"They smack their tongues back in their
mouths, somehow," answered Beppo. "They
are ugly little things, aren't they? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mother won't let me kill them when they
get in the house, because they eat up the flies
and spiders."</p>

<p>The children were walking now between two
rows of laurel-trees.</p>

<p>"How dark and glossy the leaves are," said
Lucy. "I think they are lovely. I like to
get them and make wreaths. Then I take
them up-stairs and put them on father's and
mother's heads. I pretend I am crowning
them as the heroes in Italy were crowned long
ago." Lucy forgot her Italian and fell into
English before she had half finished. It was
no wonder that Tessa and Beppo could not
understand.</p>

<p>Arthur saw the puzzled look in their faces
and tried to explain. He was older than
his sister and could speak Italian better than
she.</p>

<p>"Lucy means this: I suppose you know
that your country was once very great."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Beppo nodded his head. Oh, yes, and he
believed it to be very great, still.</p>

<p>"And Rome was the leading city in the
whole wide world," Arthur went on. "Great
deeds were done by her people; great battles
were fought; great books were written; great
palaces were built. Well, in the olden times,
whenever a person had done some truly great
thing, he was crowned with a wreath of laurels.
Father told me this, so I know it must be
true.</p>

<p>"But come, I am afraid your father will be
waiting for you. I didn't notice how fast the
time was going."</p>

<p>They hurried back to the house. There,
to be sure, were Pietro and his master. It
had been a fine day. The fruit was all sold
for a good price, and their father was eager
to hear how the time had passed with his
children.</p>

<p>"Oh, babbo, babbo, they were so kind, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
good Americans. And I am very happy,"
said Tessa. She said this softly as she leaned
over the donkey's side to pat her father's face
while they were on the way home.</p>

<p>"The little girl (her name is Lucy, babbo,)
did not seem to notice my bare feet and darned
frock. She held my hand a long time, and I
know I shall love her."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STORY OF ÆNEAS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> after day Tessa and Beppo travelled
over the road to Rome with their father.
They were always happy, always gentle, always
merry.</p>

<p>The artist and his family grew to love the
children and wish they could do something to
make their lives easier.</p>

<p>"They are so poor," Lucy told her brother
one night, "that they eat meat only at great
times, like Christmas. It costs too much for
them to buy it every day as mother does.
But they have plenty of fruit. I think the
delicious figs and apricots that grow here in
this country make up for a good deal of meat.
And their mother makes salads of all kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
vegetables. Perhaps they don't miss the meat
as long as they are not used to eating it as
we are."</p>

<p>"How did you know about their food?"
asked Lucy's mother, who happened to hear
what she said.</p>

<p>"It came about this way, mamma. We
were in the kitchen the other day. I wanted
to watch the maid cooking over the charcoal
flames in that queer stone stove. And Tessa
said then she had seen such a big piece of
meat roasting for dinner only two or three
times in her life. Then we went on talking
and she spoke of what she usually had at
home. Her mother uses olive oil in almost
everything, just as our cook does. I should
think it would be better than the lard we have
in America, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, for it is much more wholesome.
It is obtained from olives, you know,
instead of the fat of pigs. People would use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more of it in America if it did not cost so much
by the time it has travelled across the ocean.
But I hear your father's footsteps. Let us go
and meet him."</p>

<p>The artist was not alone, for Tessa was with
him. She was looking much pleased.</p>

<p>"It is raining hard," said Mr. Gray, "and
I have just seen Tessa's father and asked him
to let her spend the night with us. It is too
great a storm for her to go out in. The little
girl has done finely for me to-day, and she sat
so well that I got along on my picture quite
rapidly. So she will dine with us to-night
and I will tell you stories in Italian. After
that, we will have games."</p>

<p>Lucy ran and put her arms around Tessa's
neck.</p>

<p>"What a good time we shall have," she
cried. "Father tells lovely stories. Oh,
Tessa, I wish you were my own sister."</p>

<p>Tessa turned her big dark eyes to the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
There were tears in them, but they were tears
of gladness. She had never had a cross word
spoken to her in her whole life. She had
never been punished for any little fault. But
her loving little heart had not expected this:
that the American child who was always
dressed so beautifully, whose parents seemed
so rich in her eyes, should wish a sister like
her, a peasant girl. She could scarcely believe
it.</p>

<p>The dinner seemed a very grand one to
Tessa. One surprise was brought in after
another. There were four separate courses!
Last, came a delicious ice and frosted cakes.
It seemed to the little Italian like a feast of
the fairies.</p>

<p>After the dinner was over, the family went
into the great drawing-room. Rugs were
stretched here and there over the marble floor.
There were soft couches and odd, spider-legged
tables and chairs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"We don't own the furniture," Lucy told
her visitor. "It belongs here in the palace
and is the same kind as the prince uses. He
lives below us. It is beautiful, father thinks,
but he does wish we could be warmer on these
cold, windy days. You have very queer stoves
in your country, Tessa. You should feel the
heat that comes from ours in America." And
Lucy held her hands over the jar filled with
burning charcoal. It certainly gave the room
little extra warmth.</p>

<p>"You look cold," Tessa answered, with her
voice full of sympathy. "I do not feel so,
though. I suppose it is because I have lived
out-of-doors most of my life. But think, we
do not have much weather like this, and it
will soon be spring."</p>

<p>Yes, it was true. Christmas would be here
in a few days, and then, then, the lovely spring
would open with its violets, its daisies, and its
strawberries.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you ready with your story, father?"
asked Lucy, as she perched herself on the arm
of his chair. Arthur stretched himself on a
rug at his father's feet, and at the same time
drew Tessa on her low stool to his side.</p>

<p>"I shall have to be ready, at any rate, I
think," her father answered, laughing. "So
prepare to listen closely, for I must speak in
Italian, that Tessa may understand.</p>

<p>"I wish you to imagine a time of long ago,"
he went on. "It was before any history was
written about this country. There were many
different tribes of people who lived along the
shores of the rivers and built temples to
strange gods. Those people believed in a god
of the forest, and others of the ocean, the
fruits, and the grains. Festivals were held in
their honour.</p>

<p>"After many years, the country became great
and powerful. This city was built and ships
were sent from it to all parts of the known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
world. It was at this time also that art and
poetry flourished. Sculptors modelled beautiful
statues that we count among our greatest
treasures to-day. And men wrote great books
that you, Lucy and Arthur, will study, by
and by.</p>

<p>"One of these writers was Virgil. He
wrote in Latin, the language spoken by these
people. The soft Italian words in use now
are pleasant to the ear, but not as strong and
grand as the old Latin tongue."</p>

<p>"Doesn't any one speak in Latin now,
father?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"No, my dear. But it is studied, and the
books written in Latin are read by scholars.
Our own English language would be very poor
if it had not received a great deal of help from
the Latin. In fact, the same thing can be said
of nearly every language used in the Western
world to-day. But I am afraid you are getting
tired. I will go back to my story.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was written by the poet Virgil, and tells
of the wonderful things that happened to a
prince called Æneas. He lived in Troy and
was always called the Pious Æneas. This
was because he was so good to his old
father, and honoured the gods in whom he
believed."</p>

<p>"Did he really live, father, or is this only a
legend?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"We think now it is a legend, but the story
is written as if every word were true, and belonged
to the real history of Italy. But let
me go on with my story.</p>

<p>"Æneas and his people had been conquered
in a great battle, and their city was given up
to their enemies. The young prince fled in
the darkness, carrying his father on his back,
and leading his little boy by the hand. His
wife followed behind them. The old man
carefully held some little images. They must
not be left behind or lost, for they represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the gods in whom the Trojans believed and
whom they worshipped.</p>

<p>"When they had gone a little way, Æneas
found that his wife was no longer following
them. What could have happened to her?
He looked for her everywhere, but it was of
no use. No trace of her could be found, and
she was never heard of again.</p>

<p>"When Æneas and his men reached Mount
Ida they built some ships and set sail. They
would find a new home for themselves."</p>

<p>"But where was their old home, father?
You called it Troy," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"Troy was a place in Asia Minor, near the
strait with the long name of the Hellespont.
This strait separates that part of Asia from
Greece, and the rest of Europe. You can
easily find it on your map. But remember
this, as I go on,&mdash;in olden times the ships
were small and people knew little about the
seas or the great ocean, and seldom went far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
from home. What you would think of as a
short voyage would have seemed a very long
one to the people then.</p>

<p>"Many wonderful things happened to
Æneas after he left Troy. After a while his
provisions gave out, and he landed on the
shore of an island to get some food. He
found wild goats grazing there, and his men
killed some of them. While they were feasting
on the flesh of these creatures, the harpies
appeared. They had the bodies of birds, but
the faces of ugly old women."</p>

<p>Tessa shuddered. "Are there any real
harpies?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, no, Tessa. Remember that this is
only a legend.</p>

<p>"These horrible bird-hags flew down into
the midst of the Trojans and destroyed their
dinner. The men shot at them, but the arrows
glanced off of the feathers, and not one of the
harpies was harmed. Although most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
flew far away, they were very angry. One of
them stayed long enough to cry in a harsh
voice:</p>

<p>"'You Trojans shall be punished for troubling
us. You shall be tossed about on the
ocean until you reach Italy, and you shall not
build a city for yourselves until you are so
hungry that you will be willing to eat the
trenchers containing the food.'</p>

<p>"This was what people called a prophecy,
and, as Æneas and his men believed in such
things, it made them feel far from cheerful.</p>

<p>"He sailed away, however, and came at
length to another place, where he found old
friends. His cousin, Helenus, who had also
been driven away from Troy, was ruling there,
and he had built a new city for himself and his
comrades.</p>

<p>"Helenus was a prophet, as it seemed, and
he told Æneas that after he reached Italy he
would find an old white sow with thirty little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pigs around her. He must build a city for
himself wherever he should find her.</p>

<p>"Æneas had many other adventures after
leaving Helenus. Among other things, he
met a horrible giant who had lost the sight of
his one eye, but was still terrible. After this,
the old father of Æneas died, and the son's
sad loss was followed by a fearful storm in
which the men nearly gave up hope of seeing
land again. The ships were driven far to the
south.</p>

<p>"After the wind had died down and the
waves had grown calmer, the homeless wanderers
came to a quiet bay. They landed and
found a lovely queen who treated Æneas so
kindly that he almost forgot the city he had
planned to build in Italy. But after awhile
the god Mercury appeared to him and reminded
him of his duty.</p>

<p>"He set sail once more, leaving the beautiful
queen so unhappy that she killed herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with a sword her visitor had left behind.
There were many other adventures, but, at
last, Æneas came to the shores of Italy, where
he rested in a grove. He and his followers
sat around on the grass to eat. They used
large, round cakes for plates on which to
place the meat. After it was gone, they
began to eat the cakes. Then Æneas's little
son said:</p>

<p>"'We are eating our trenchers.'</p>

<p>"When he heard these words Æneas
thought of the harpy's prophecy. He knew
at once that his home was to be here."</p>

<p>"Was it where Rome stands now?" asked
Lucy.</p>

<p>"No, the place was called Cumæ. There is
another story about the building of Rome
which you may like to hear some other evening.
Let us play games for awhile, and then,
little ones, for bed and pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>Every one joined in a game of blind man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
buff. Tessa had never played it before and
she enjoyed it very much. Then she showed
them how to play one of the games she had
learned from the children of her own village.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHRISTMAS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>," said Lucy, one day late in
December, "Tessa says she never gets presents
on Christmas Day. Those always come
on Twelfth Night in Italy. What a queer
idea! But she says there are processions in
the churches, and all sorts of beautiful sights.
Will father take us to Saint Peter's then, do
you think?"</p>

<p>Lucy had only been in Italy six months and
there were many interesting things she had
not seen yet.</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered her mother. "Your
father and I have been thinking of asking
both Tessa and Beppo to spend Christmas
week with us. You will enjoy the sights all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the more if you have them with you. What
do you think?"</p>

<p>Lucy was so pleased she jumped up and
down in delight.</p>

<p>"You good, kind mother," she cried. "Of
course, it will be lovely."</p>

<p>That very night Tessa's father was asked if
he would be willing his children should visit the
artist's family. The good man's face beamed
with pride. Oh, yes, he was only too glad
they should have such an honour and pleasure.
He knew his wife would also rejoice.</p>

<p>There was to be no trouble about the
clothes. A new suit was already waiting for
Beppo, while the artist's wife had herself made
two pretty dresses for Tessa.</p>

<p>"You are too kind," cried the peasant.
His hands seemed to say this as well as his
voice. What would an Italian do without
hands to help him in talking? Sometimes
they seem to express more than his voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way it came to pass that Tessa and
Beppo bade good-bye to the little village on
the hillside for nearly two weeks. They must
be home at Twelfth Night, however, to bring
presents to mother and Francesca. Oh, yes,
there was no doubt of that.</p>

<p>But in the meantime it was to be a holiday.
The children were not to sit as models for one
minute. The artist would let his brushes rest
and go about the city with his family and
their young visitors.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve came at last, although the
hours before it arrived seemed like weeks to
the excited children.</p>

<p>A carriage drove up to the palace door.
They were all to drive to a beautiful church
called Santa Maria Maggiore, where the Pope
himself would be that night.</p>

<p>"Why is he such a great man, and why do
the people give him such reverence?" asked
Arthur.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Tessa heard the question. Her pretty face
flushed. "Why, Arthur, he is the head of
our church, the Catholic Church," she answered,
quickly. "It is not only here in
Italy, but all over the world that we Catholics
honour him!"</p>

<p>The little girl was ignorant about many
things in her own city that Lucy and Arthur
could explain to her, but she had been taught
from birth to think of the Pope as the most
holy person in the world.</p>

<p>But why was the Pope to be present in the
church Christmas Eve? The children had
already been told that on this occasion a piece
of the cradle in which Jesus had lain was to be
carried through the church. At least, Tessa
and her brother and all good Catholics believed
it to be a part of his cradle. They
thought that by some miracle it had been
saved for nineteen hundred years, and was
now cared for sacredly in their loved city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Any one who wished, might look upon it at
Christmas time.</p>

<p>The peasant children believed it could do
great wonders. Why, if they were sick, and
even dying, it might save their lives if they
were allowed to touch it.</p>

<p>Tessa whispered this to Lucy as they mixed
with the people entering the church. They
passed along between two rows of beautiful
marble columns. They were obliged to move
slowly because the crowd was so great. But
Lucy's father soon led them to the doorway
of a small chapel, where they could stand while
the procession passed up to the altar. The
sacred cradle was carried first, and behind it
followed the Pope with the cardinals and other
high officers of the church.</p>

<p>The Pope was carried in a chair above the
heads of the people and, as he passed along,
he held out his hands to bless them as they
knelt before him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Tessa and Beppo had never looked upon
him before. Indeed, they were scarcely able
to see him or any other part of the procession
now, because of the great crowd. But they
knew he was there and that they were near
him. This was enough to satisfy their pious
little hearts. Lucy and Arthur were most
pleased to think that these Italian friends were
made so happy.</p>

<p>"Is that all, father?" Lucy whispered.
"It is hot and close here. Can't we go home
now and have our Christmas tree?"</p>

<p>Her father said that he was quite willing to
go, for he saw that his wife was as tired as his
little daughter.</p>

<p>An hour afterward they were in the great
drawing-room at home. Many candles gave
a soft and pleasant light to the room; for gas
and electricity were not used in many Roman
houses.</p>

<p>A curtain was drawn, and there stood a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
beautiful Christmas tree,&mdash;not of pine or
balsam, such as Lucy and Arthur would have
in America. It was of laurel.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" exclaimed Beppo. He
had never seen anything like it before, for his
people are not used to this custom of having
Christmas trees. And Tessa's eyes sparkled,
too, as she drew one long sigh of happiness.
What beauty met her eyes! Was it indeed
fairy-land,&mdash;these tiny lights shining on every
twig of the tree; gilded oranges hanging from
the branches; and toys, so many she was sure
she could not count them.</p>

<p>Could it be true that this lovely wax doll
was her very own? Lucy's father had said so,
but she was afraid she might rub her eyes and
wake, and find it all a dream.</p>

<p>As for Beppo, he was equally delighted
to find himself the owner of a jack-knife
with four blades, a fine ball with which he
could teach the American children his favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
game of pallone, in which he was very
skilful.</p>

<p>There were neither skates nor sleds. They
would be of no use in Italy, the land of sunny
skies, where snow is unknown except on the
high mountain-tops.</p>

<p>The evening was a merry one, but it came
to an end at last.</p>

<p>"To bed, to bed, children," Lucy's mother
cried at length. "To-morrow there will be
more sights, and you must not get sick over
your good time."</p>

<p>Christmas morning dawned bright and clear.</p>

<p>The children waked early and did not seem
any the worse for sitting up so late the night
before. Soon after breakfast, an open carriage
appeared at the door of the palace and they all
rode off to visit the greatest church in the
world.</p>

<p>"At last we are on our way to Saint Peter's,"
said Arthur. "Tessa, you may well be proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
when you think of the people who come here
from all parts of the world to see the grand
buildings."</p>

<p>Tessa was proud. This was her Italy, her
Rome, her Saint Peter's. She, a poor little
peasant maiden, felt richer at this moment than
the owner of a million dollars.</p>

<p>The party had to ride over a bridge before
they could reach the church.</p>

<p>"Do you know the name of the river over
which this bridge is built?" Arthur asked his
sister.</p>

<p>"The Tiber, the yellow Tiber," she answered
gaily. "You ought to remember,
Arthur, that father read us the poem a few
days ago about the guarding of the bridge. It
made a shiver creep down my back when I
thought of the three men holding the bridge
against the army of their enemies. It stretched
across this very river."</p>

<p>"It was hundreds of years ago," Lucy went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
on, turning toward Tessa, "that those brave
men saved the city. They kept the enemy
from entering until the bridge was cut down.
The last one stood on guard until he felt the
supports give way. Then he cried out to the
river:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'O Tiber, Father Tiber, to whom the Romans pray,<br />
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms take thou in charge this day.'<br />
</div>

<p>"An instant afterward he jumped into the
rushing stream and swam with all his might
back to his people and the city he had saved."</p>

<p>"Did he escape?" Beppo asked. "I
should think his enemies would have killed
him before he was able to get out of the reach
of their weapons."</p>

<p>"They admired his bravery so much they
had mercy on him and did not try to hit him
after he jumped into the water. Then they
turned away, for they could not reach Rome
now that the bridge was destroyed."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>As Lucy finished the story she could not
help saying to herself, "I do hope Tessa and
Beppo will be able to go to school and study
about this grand country of theirs. They love
it as dearly as I love America, but they do not
know as much of the history of its great men
as I do now."</p>

<p>Her father was thinking at the same time,
"What a pity it is there are so many poor
and ignorant people in Italy. How I wish
the children of to-day could grow up and
make the country what it was once."</p>

<p>The sun was shining so brightly by this
time that the girls had to raise their parasols
to shade their eyes as they looked along the
crowded street. It was filled with carriages all
going in the same direction as themselves.
The sidewalks, too, were packed closely.
There were all kinds of people; lords and
ladies, priests in their shovel hats, cardinals in
their elegant robes. All would soon enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
great church. Their faces looked happy and
full of joy.</p>

<p>"Shall we not be crowded worse than we
were last night?" asked Mrs. Gray. She
looked a little bit worried.</p>

<p>"O no, you need have no fear about that,"
her husband replied. "Forty thousand people
can easily gather in Saint Peter's and then it
will not be full, by any means."</p>

<p>The carriage stopped in front of a long covered
archway built of marble. They stepped
down and, entering it, soon found themselves
in the court in front of the church.</p>

<p>The church itself is built in the shape of an
immense cross, and where the four lines of the
cross meet, there is a huge dome overhead.</p>

<p>"I can see the dome of Saint Peter's from
my home on the mountain," Tessa said to
Lucy. "If I were far away in another part
of the world, I am sure I should picture it in
my mind whenever I thought of Rome."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SAINT PETER'S</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children now entered the great building.
What a glory of colour was around them.
There was a blaze of gold and purple and
crimson. The windows were set with glass of
all the beautiful tints of the rainbow. The
floors were laid in small pieces of marble in
exquisite patterns.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lucy, Lucy," whispered Tessa, "look
at the walls and pillars! Gems such as your
mother wears are shining there. And how
beautifully they are carved."</p>

<p>Lucy's only answer was, "Look overhead,
Tessa, and see the paintings. There are the
figures of the apostles. They appear as large
as life, although we are so far below them."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="415" height="600" alt="inside cathedral" />
<span class="caption">IN ST. PETER&#39;S</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Just then her father told her to notice the
pen in St. Luke's hand.</p>

<p>"I have been told that it is seven feet in
length," he said, "yet it is so far away it seems
only as long as the one you use at home,
Lucy."</p>

<p>Soft music was now heard pealing from the
organ, and they moved slowly along to the
seats Mr. Gray had engaged for them.</p>

<p>"Look, look, Lucy!" whispered Tessa, a
few minutes after. "He is coming, and we
can see him to-day, I am sure."</p>

<p>It was the Pope, of course. Two enormous
fans could be seen waving at the other end of
the great building. The procession of priests
and cardinals, in their purple robes, moved
slowly and grandly along. The Pope was
behind them in a chair carried on poles by
twelve bearers. The fans were kept waving
on each side of the great man.</p>

<p>As he passed onward between the rows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
soldiers in their gorgeous uniforms, they knelt
before him.</p>

<p>"He holds out only two fingers of his hand
over the bent heads of the people. That is
all there is of the blessing, I suppose," said
Arthur. "But he smiles pleasantly, and has a
kind face."</p>

<p>At last the procession reached the altar.
The Pope stood up before the people, and
they could see he was robed in white. He
chanted the service, after which a choir of
beautiful voices began to sing. The balcony
where the singers stood was richly gilded.</p>

<p>When the service was ended, Mr. Gray told
the children to wait quietly where they were.</p>

<p>"When most of the people have passed
out," he said, "we will walk about and examine
this beautiful cathedral more carefully.
There is a great deal you have not seen
yet."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the building was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
empty, and Mr. Gray led the way from one
part of it to another. He opened the door
into one of the chapels at the side.</p>

<p>"Look within," he said. "This chapel is
as large as an ordinary church. Yet there are
a number just like it which lead from the main
part of the cathedral. They seem tiny beside
it, though."</p>

<p>Tessa and Beppo loved to stop at the different
shrines where the figures of Jesus and his
mother, Mary, were always found. They were
beautifully carved and sparkled with rich
jewels.</p>

<p>"Now let us visit the statue of St. Peter
himself," said Mr. Gray. "Some say it was
never meant for that good man, but is really
the likeness of a heathen emperor. But nearly
every one who worships here does not wish to
believe that. And so many visitors have come
here to give him honour that one toe of the
statue is a good deal worn off."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean, father?" asked
Lucy.</p>

<p>"Just what I said, my dear. It is thought
to be quite proper to kiss the toe of the statue
of St. Peter. I don't know how the fashion
started, but, at any rate, I believe thousands
upon thousands of people have knelt before
the statue and done that very thing. You
can see the marks of it for yourself."</p>

<p>After St. Peter had been duly examined,
Mr. Gray proposed that a visit should be
made to the wonderful dome.</p>

<p>"But there are a good many stairs to climb.
Do you think, wife, that you will be able to
mount them?"</p>

<p>"If the little girls can do it, I am sure that
I can," replied Mrs. Gray, as she turned to
Tessa and Lucy. It was quite easy to see by
their smiles and nods that they were eager to
try it.</p>

<p>"Then let us start at once," said her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
husband, beckoning to a guide to show the
way.</p>

<p>They passed through a door in the side of
the church, and entered a passage which
wound round and round, yet up and still up,
till they reached a balcony around the foot of
the dome. The stairway by which they had
come was so broad and rose so gradually that
one could easily mount it on horseback.</p>

<p>"Many a person has ridden to the top on
a donkey," the guide told the children, which
amused them very much.</p>

<p>As they looked down from the balcony, the
people in the body of the church seemed like
tiny dolls, they were so far below.</p>

<p>"But this is not all," said Mr. Gray. "As
soon as you stop panting, we will go higher
yet."</p>

<p>"All ready, father," said Lucy, after a five
minutes' rest. "I'm sure we are equal to
another climb now."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The next flight of stairs was very narrow.
It led to another balcony around the top of
the dome.</p>

<p>"Do not think this is all," said Mr. Gray.
"We can go higher yet, for we have not
reached the lantern."</p>

<p>After much puffing and gasping for breath,
and the climbing of more narrow stairs, they
found themselves in a large room inside the
lantern. As they looked out of the windows
in that lofty place, a wonderful view was spread
before their eyes. Below was the square, and
leading out from it were many archways with
curved tops, like the one through which the
children first entered the church. The palace
of the Pope was at hand, with its wonderful
library and art treasures.</p>

<p>Beyond, across the Tiber, lay the great city,
with its palaces, fountains, temples, and the
ruins of the greatest and finest buildings in the
world; some of them two thousand years old.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can look far out upon the sea that Columbus
first sailed," exclaimed Arthur. "Indeed,
it seems as if I could almost see Spain,
where he went to get help. You know the
story of Columbus, don't you, Beppo?"</p>

<p>The Italian lad shook his head. No, but
he wished to hear it. Would Arthur tell him
the story some day?</p>

<p>Arthur said he would be glad to do so, for,
although Columbus was an Italian, he felt that
he belonged to America. Where would he be
now, if Columbus had not discovered the new
world? Who should say?</p>

<p>"Look straight down at the roof of the
church below us," cried Lucy. "Did you
ever hear of anything so odd? There is a
little cottage! The idea of a house built on
the roof of a church! What can be the reason
for its being there?"</p>

<p>"It is only a room made for the workmen,"
said the guide. "They are busy all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the time repairing the church in one part or
another."</p>

<p>"Now let us go home and have the Christmas
dinner," said Mr. Gray, after they had
rested a few moments longer.</p>

<p>An hour afterward the children were gathered
around the great dining-table. But there
was no Christmas turkey in the middle. There
was a dish of larks instead!</p>

<p>"Poor little birds," said Lucy. "It is too
bad to kill tiny things like you, that we may
have something nice to eat."</p>

<p>"What is the bird of your country, Beppo?"
asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I think it ought to be
the nightingale," the little Italian answered.
"Ah! I love to hear him, he sings so
sweetly." The boy's face lighted up as he
said this. "And what is the bird of America,
Arthur?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The eagle has been chosen, but I think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
ought to be the turkey, for my country gave
that glorious fowl to the world."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gray laughed at Arthur's
words, but a moment after his father said:</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, my boy. The
turkey truly belongs to us, while the eagle is
not only found in many other lands, but it has
been the national emblem of several countries."</p>

<p>The Christmas holidays passed only too
quickly, and the day before Twelfth Night
soon arrived. The shops were full of things
suitable for presents, and a great fair was held
in the city, around which crowds of Italians
were busy buying their gifts. Beppo and
Tessa wandered up and down with their
American friends.</p>

<p>They were perplexed as to what they should
get for their dear ones at home. There were
many things from which to choose. They
felt as though they had quite a little fortune
to spend, for Mr. Gray had given each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
them what would be equal to a dollar in our
money.</p>

<p>They had never had so much money before,
and they turned from one thing to another
before they finally decided upon a dress and a
big gilt brooch for their mother, a new hat for
their father, and little red kid shoes for Francesca.</p>

<p>"She never had any shoes in her life,"
Tessa told Lucy. "I never had any either,
till your mother gave me these."</p>

<p>When the peasant called at the palace to
take the children home, he brought great
news.</p>

<p>"We have a new baby," he said. "It is a
beautiful boy just a day old. And now we
must have a christening as soon as Twelfth
Night is over. We will ask the kind artist
and his wife, as well as our own friends, to
come."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHRISTENING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Tessa</span> and Beppo were so eager to see the
precious baby, they could hardly wait to get
home. They were even a little cross with
Pietro when he stopped to nibble choice bits
of grass by the roadside. But what could a
poor stupid donkey be expected to care about
a baby only a day old?</p>

<p>Home was reached at last, however, and the
children bounded into the dark room where
their mother lay watching for them. A small
basket cradle stood beside the curtained bed;
in it was the sweetest, tiniest baby.</p>

<p>"He is sound asleep, mamma," said Tessa,
after kissing her mother at least a dozen times.
"How I wish he would wake."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do believe he looks like me, the darling
little boy," she exclaimed, when the baby's
eyes opened at last.</p>

<p>The kind neighbour who had come in to
look after the family for a few days lifted the
baby tenderly and placed him in Tessa's arms.
He was so swaddled in clothes and blankets
it didn't seem as though he could be hurt,
even if the little girl should drop the precious
bundle. But there was no fear of that. She
was used to babies, and had taken almost all
the care of Francesca since that little girl was
a month old.</p>

<p>But where was Francesca now? The little
tot was holding fast to her sister's dress. She
wanted to be as near as possible to this wonderful
new brother. When he began to cry,
she said:</p>

<p>"Baby wants the candle; baby wants the
candle." She thought he had already begun
to notice things about the room, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
longing for the lighted candle. Everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>"He is hungry; that is all, you foolish
Francesca. You are only a baby yourself,"
said Beppo.</p>

<p>After the baby had been put back in the
cradle, Tessa went to the bedside of her mother
and told her of her lovely visit to the grand
home of the Americans.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, when you are not so tired, I
will tell you more about it. But after all
home is the best place in the world. Now
that I can look at you, I don't care if I can't
see the procession to-morrow. Just think!
babbo says that an image of the Holy Child is
carried up and down the aisles of one of the
churches. It is richly dressed in silks and jewels.
After awhile it is placed on a stage with wax
figures of the Virgin and Joseph and the Three
Wise Men. There is even a manger there, and
a big cow or ox. It must be very beautiful."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you are older, we will go together,"
said the mother, softly. "I went to Rome on
Twelfth Day several times when I was younger.
But many things have happened to prevent it
lately." She sighed as she thought of the
sickness and the hard work of the last few
years.</p>

<p>All the next day Francesca was so happy
with the bright red shoes that she did not
need to be watched. Every one, except the
dear mother lying quietly behind the snowy
bed-curtains, was busy preparing for the
christening.</p>

<p>A bright fire was kept burning, and the
odour of onions and garlic filled the kitchen.
There must be all sorts of nice
dishes at the morrow's feast, and the good
neighbour was cooking from morning till
night.</p>

<p>Among other things, she prepared some
wonderful cakes. Tessa thought they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
among the greatest dainties in the world.
There were olives and pistachio-nuts and
garlic in them, I am sure. Tessa would have
to tell you the rest, for she helped in making
them.</p>

<p>Every one was awake bright and early the
next morning, and a crowd of the village
people went with the father and baby to the
little village church. Tessa and Beppo kept
as near as possible to their new brother.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gray, with Lucy and Arthur,
arrived in a carriage just as the party was
entering the church door. The children had
begged so hard to come that their parents
could not refuse.</p>

<p>Tessa and Lucy hugged and kissed each
other as though they had been apart for a long
time.</p>

<p>When all had entered the church, the baby
was carried to the font and was baptized by
the kind-faced priest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>What was his name now, you ask? It was
Angelo, after his proud father, who handed
him around among his friends as soon as the
baptism was over. Every one must have a
chance to kiss him. As he was passed from
one to another, a piece of money was tucked
away in his clothes by each one.</p>

<p>No matter how poor the person was, some
little bit was given with a right good will. It
was but a symbol of the love and friendship
of these simple peasants for each other.</p>

<p>When Mr. Gray's turn came, he hid in the
baby's dress a piece of money so big as to
make his mother's eyes open with delight
when it was shown her afterward. She had
never before seen a gold coin worth ten dollars
in her life.</p>

<p>The christening party now turned back to
the house, where the mother lay waiting for
them. The feast was all spread and the
visitors gathered around the table with good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
appetites. Lucy and Arthur and their parents
stayed, for Tessa's father looked quite hurt
when they spoke of going home.</p>

<p>"Not stop to share our feast!" he cried.
"Ah! that is sad! sad!"</p>

<p>And so they remained and took part in the
merrymaking. Some of the villagers played
on their bagpipes. Tessa performed a very
pretty dance, and Beppo sang two songs with
his rich, soft voice.</p>

<p>"We have had a lovely time," said Lucy,
as the beautiful colours began to light the sunset
sky, and her father bade her get ready to
leave. "But we wish Tessa and Beppo to
come home and stay with us another week.
Don't we, father?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gray answered, "Yes, we should like
it very much. After my holiday, I must paint
quite steadily, and I wish to finish the picture
of Tessa and Beppo at once. It would not
be easy for you to bring the children to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
every day now that your wife is sick. So
please let them go back with us."</p>

<p>This was how Tessa and Beppo came to go
back to Rome with the family of the artist.
The carriage was a little crowded, but no one
cared. All were so busy laughing and talking
that it seemed only a few minutes before they
drew near the city gates.</p>

<p>"I believe it was not far from here that
Agrippa told the people the fable so often
repeated since that time."</p>

<p>The painter was looking out of the carriage
over the Campagna.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew the exact spot," he said,
half to himself.</p>

<p>"Tell us about it; do, please, father," said
Lucy. "What was the fable, and who was
Agrippa, and why did he come out on this
dreary place to tell a story?"</p>

<p>"It was a long time ago; even long before
the birth of Jesus," Mr. Gray replied. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was when Rome was a powerful city. There
were two great classes of the people,&mdash;the
patricians, who were rich and owned most of
the land, and the plebeians, who had little
power and were mostly poor.</p>

<p>"The patricians ruled the city to suit themselves
and did not treat the plebeians justly.
At last, when they could not stand this unfair
treatment any longer, they came together and
marched out of the city.</p>

<p>"'We will claim our rights,' they said,
and made ready to attack the patricians, who
remained in Rome.</p>

<p>"It was a time of danger for the city, since
there was a greater number of the poor than
of the rich. What should be done? A very
wise man named Agrippa was chosen to go out
on the Campagna and reason with the plebeians.
When he drew near to them, he said:</p>

<p>"'I have a fable which I wish to tell you.
It is this:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Once upon a time all the limbs of a
man's body became provoked because they
had to work for the stomach. The legs and
feet were obliged to carry it about; the
hands had to get food for it; the mouth ate
for it; the throat swallowed for it; the head
thought for it; and so on. They said it was
a shame they had to work so hard for that one
organ. What use was it, indeed!</p>

<p>"'They agreed to do nothing more for it at
all. They stopped their work, but, strange to
say, they began to grow weak and helpless.
At last they said to each other, "We shall all
starve and die unless we go back to our old
work. The stomach has seemed useless to us
before, but now we see that we were mistaken."'</p>

<p>"After he had ended his story, Agrippa
went on to say that all classes of people
depended on each other, and that all would
perish unless they worked together.</p>

<p>"Both the poor and the rich seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
think that this was good advice. The plebeians
marched back into the city and took up
their old work, while the patricians promised
to be fairer in their dealings.</p>

<p>"Thus peace was made and Rome was
saved."</p>

<p>As Mr. Gray finished the story the carriage
drew up in front of their home.</p>

<p>"What a short ride it seemed," said Tessa.
"It must have been because of the story you
told us, Mr. Gray. I shall never forget it."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TWINS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Tessa</span> and Beppo are two of the best
models I ever had," said Mr. Gray. "They
were perfectly quiet and did just what I
wished. My picture is finished and you must
all come up and look at it."</p>

<p>It was a sunny afternoon nearly a week after
the christening of Tessa's baby brother. Lucy
and Arthur were in the drawing-room with
their mother when Mr. Gray opened the door
with these words.</p>

<p>There was a great scampering over the stairs
as the two children tried to see who could
reach the studio first.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely, how lovely!" cried
Lucy, who was the winner of the race. She
was standing in front of the canvas.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>And what do you think she saw? A little
flower-girl out on the Campagna. She sat on
the back of a donkey that certainly looked
much like Pietro. The girl's bare feet were
almost hidden by two great bags of fruit hanging
from the donkey's sides.</p>

<p>In her lap was a basket of flowers that she
would sell in the city to-day. A boy who was
the very image of Beppo held the donkey's
bridle.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you have made Tessa's
curls," said Lucy. "But they are not a bit
lovelier than hers really are. Look at the
feather in Beppo's pointed hat, Arthur, and
the gaiters buttoned up to the knees. And
see the brown cloak thrown over his shoulders.
It's the very way he wears it."</p>

<p>"But you haven't noticed the herd of oxen
in the distance," said the modest little Tessa.
She was quite abashed by the attention given
to the figures of her brother and herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"They are going back to the hillside for the
night. What a lovely soft gray they are
painted. I love these dear gentle creatures.
They could do great harm with their large,
spreading horns, but they are too kind for
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, and see the shepherds standing in
that field of daisies," said Beppo. "More
than once my father and I have stayed all
night in just such a place when the storm
overtook us and we could not get home."</p>

<p>"How I love the mountains, far away in the
soft light," said Mrs. Gray. "They make
a beautiful background for the rest of the
picture."</p>

<p>"When you have admired it as much as
you like, I think we had better take a half-holiday
and see some of the sights," proposed
Mr. Gray. "It is only two o'clock now; how
soon can you all be ready?"</p>

<p>"In five minutes, can't we, mother?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Lucy, who was always delighted to have her
father's company. He was usually so busy he
could not often go anywhere with them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Gray. "We will not
delay. Get your hats, children; we can come
here to-morrow to enjoy the picture again."</p>

<p>This time they decided to walk, that the
children might stop wherever they wished.</p>

<p>"What is this show? Oh, do look!"
cried Tessa, as they came to a big box set up
on the side of the street. A man could be
seen partly hidden behind the curtain. He
was making some puppets act out a little play.
He changed his voice so as to represent first
one, then another.</p>

<p>"That is a Punch and Judy show," said
Arthur. "You may watch it while I go over
to that little flower-girl's stand. I am going
to buy a bunch of pansies for mother. I think
that is the girl's grandfather standing by her
side. He must be lame, for he has a crutch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I suppose they are very poor. Perhaps that
child supports them both."</p>

<p>After Arthur had bought his flowers, they
walked on till they came to a shrine set up
against the wall. It was a picture of Saint
Mary and the infant Jesus in a rough wooden
frame.</p>

<p>Tessa and Beppo knelt before it and were
very quiet for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"They are repeating some prayers," whispered
Lucy to her brother, as they passed
slowly on. "When we rode back from
Tessa's home the other night, I noticed she
suddenly stopped talking and shut her eyes
when we passed one of those shrines out on
the Campagna."</p>

<p>"She is a good little Catholic."</p>

<p>"Arthur, look at that poor donkey. You
can't see anything but his legs and his nose.
He is carrying such a big load of hay that the
rest of his body is out of sight."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Their father came up to them at this
moment, and said: "How would you like to
take a carriage now and visit the Coliseum?
We still have plenty of time, and I have never
been there with you."</p>

<p>"Good! good!" cried the children.</p>

<p>While they were waiting for the carriage
they bought some of the big Italian chestnuts
at a stand where a boy stood roasting them
for the passers-by.</p>

<p>They had not ridden far before they came
upon a crowd of people around a fire.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"I think I know," Tessa answered. "They
are heating pine-cones so as to get the seeds.
Did you ever eat them, Lucy? I am very
fond of them."</p>

<p>"What a queer idea! But then, your pine-trees
are different from any I have seen growing
at home. I don't doubt they are very
nice."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>When they drove up in front of the Coliseum,
they saw before them one of the grandest
ruins in the world. It was built when Rome
was still a great city, and was made to hold
eighty thousand people.</p>

<p>"Why do you speak of it as a 'sacred ruin,'
father?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"Whenever we look at it we think of the
Christians who suffered terrible deaths there
because of what they believed," Mr. Gray
answered. "The Coliseum was finished about
seventy years after the birth of Jesus. It was
the place where the public games went on and
where the wild beast shows and fights were
held.</p>

<p>"You can see that one side of the great wall
of the building is still standing in pretty good
condition. It was made in the shape of an
oval, as you also see. Now, imagine an open
space, or arena, in the middle, and all around it
rows on rows of seats, built one above the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen! Can't you imagine you hear the
roars of wild beasts that were once kept in
vaults beneath the building? When they
were needed they were drawn up in their cages
into the arena.</p>

<p>"After the spectators had taken their seats,
a signal was given and the doors of the cages
were flung open. The furious beasts would
rush out and frightful scenes would follow.
The creatures were either set against each other
or against men who had been sentenced to
death."</p>

<p>"And would people go to see such terrible
things for their own pleasure?" asked Tessa.
Her face was full of pain at the idea.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear. It showed that the city
was in a bad state when the Romans could take
delight in seeing other creatures suffer, whether
they were men or beasts," was the answer.</p>

<p>"But I told you that we of to-day hold the
place sacred to the Christians. That is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in those sad times they were cruelly put to
death here. One good bishop, I remember,
was killed by lions in this very spot. But
he went to his death cheerfully,&mdash;he was glad
to be a martyr to his faith."</p>

<p>"It looks bright and pleasant now," said
Mrs. Gray. "It is hard to believe that such
dreadful things ever took place here. See
the pretty vines growing out between the
stones in the wall; and listen to the shouts
of those boys as they run and jump among
the ruins."</p>

<p>As the children seemed ready for a change,
Mr. Gray proposed that they should visit the
Capitol, where they could see many beautiful
statues; after which, they must go home, for
the afternoon was nearly gone.</p>

<p>That evening Lucy took her place on one
arm of her father's chair and told Tessa to
take the other.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said she, "stop talking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
be quiet, and perhaps father won't be too tired
to tell us about the building of Rome. Will
you, father dear?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gray could never refuse his little
daughter when she spoke like that. And if
this had not been enough, there were Tessa's
great soft eyes looking at him. They seemed
to say, "Oh, do, please, tell us," although
Tessa herself was too shy to ask him with her
voice.</p>

<p>"About Rome, you say. All right.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time there were two little
boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But when was this 'once upon a time?'"
interrupted Arthur. "You began the story of
Æneas with the very same words."</p>

<p>"It was quite a while after Æneas settled in
Italy. The two boys were his great-great-great-grandchildren;
thirteen times great, I
believe. Their mother was a vestal virgin,&mdash;that
is, she was a maiden who tended the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fire in the temple of the goddess Vesta. Such
maidens were treated with great honour, but
they were not allowed to marry.</p>

<p>"So the people were very angry when the
young girl claimed that the god Mars was her
husband, and that the two baby boys were his
and her children. So the poor girl was buried
alive, while the helpless babies were put in a
trough and set afloat on the river Tiber."</p>

<p>"Poor little things! Were they drowned?"
asked Beppo.</p>

<p>"No, for if they had been, there would be
no more story to tell," said Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>"It happened that the river was very high
at that time and had overflowed its banks,
just as it sometimes does nowadays. The
water settled down soon afterward and the two
boys were left high and dry on the bank.</p>

<p>"And now what do you suppose came
along and saw the children?"</p>

<p>"Some bad men," answered Arthur.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"The boys' mother, who had escaped from
her grave," guessed Beppo.</p>

<p>"No. It was a mother wolf, who carried
them home to her lair and fondled and nursed
them," was the answer.</p>

<p>"After a while a shepherd discovered the
babies with their adopted mother. He was
a good man, with a kind heart, and took them
home to his wife. She gave them the names
Romulus and Remus, and brought them up to
be shepherds like her husband."</p>

<p>"Oh, father, do you suppose all this was
really true?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"No more than the story of Æneas. I
think it is a legend handed down by the
people for thousands of years. But listen,
for I have not finished, and it spoils the story
to be all the time wondering whether it is true
or not.</p>

<p>"When the twin brothers grew up, they
fought in a battle that took place between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the shepherds of the boys' grandfather, who
ought to have been king, and those of the
wrongful ruler of the country.</p>

<p>"Romulus and Remus did such brave
deeds that they were noticed and taken before
their grandfather. After many questions, he
discovered who they really were. They gathered
an army together, and marching out to
battle, seized the country in their grandfather's
name.</p>

<p>"They must build a city now for themselves,
they thought. They looked over the
seven hills on which Rome now stands. They
said the city must be on one of these hills, but
which hill should it be? Romulus chose one,
and Remus another. They could not agree.
Their grandfather said, 'Watch for a sign from
the gods.' So Romulus took his place on the
hill he had chosen, and Remus on his.</p>

<p>"Remus was the first to see any sign from
heaven. It was six vultures flying. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Romulus soon saw twelve of these birds, and
so the right was given him to found the city
on the Palatine Hill. The people chose him
king.</p>

<p>"But Remus was angry. He thought he
should have been given the right to found the
city, as he had been the first to see birds.</p>

<p>"As the mud walls were being built around
the place where the city was to stand, he leaped
over them in scorn. His brother looked upon
this as an insult, and killed him on the spot,
saying, 'Every one who leaps over the walls
of my city shall perish even as you do.'</p>

<p>"After this sad deed the work went on.
Romulus marked out his city in the shape
of a square. It is said that he did this with a
plough. He said, 'I will call my city Rome.'</p>

<p>"He lived here in a hut made of mud, with
a thatched roof.</p>

<p>"That was the beginning of this wonderful
city, so the people will tell you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Tessa nodded her head; she and Beppo had
heard the story before, and fully believed it to
be true.</p>

<p>"How long ago do they say all this happened,
father?" asked Lucy.</p>

<p>"They claim that Rome was built 753
years before the birth of Christ. If it is now
1,903 years since his birth, how many years
old is Rome?"</p>

<p>"Let me see: 753 and 1,903 are 2,656.
It was 2,656 years ago. Whew! what a long
time," said Arthur. "Many things have happened
since then."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CARNIVAL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now February. Tessa and Beppo
had been home for several weeks. The baby
was growing fast; the mother was strong again
and rosy; while the extra money which the
children had earned as models for Mr. Gray
had made the family very comfortable.</p>

<p>"How would you like to go to the carnival?"
the father asked.</p>

<p>The family were gathered around the table
where the dish of polenta had just been placed.
Polenta, you must know, is a kind of porridge
made of corn (maize) meal. It was the only
food the children would have for supper that
night. But that did not seem to trouble them.
They all looked happy, even before they heard
the word carnival.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>But this had a wonderful effect. Tessa
jumped up, caught the baby out of his cradle,
and began to dance about the room. Beppo
seized his violin and started a lively air. Their
mother began to laugh, while little Francesca
looked from one to another in surprise. She
could not understand what the sudden excitement
was about.</p>

<p>When Tessa had danced herself nearly out
of breath, she ran and put her arms around her
father's neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, babbo, babbo! do you really mean
it?" she cried. "I have never been to the
carnival, and I have heard so much about
the beautiful festival."</p>

<p>Then her mother spoke. She blushed like
a young girl as she said to her husband:</p>

<p>"It would seem like old times before we
were married, to go to the gay carnival
together. But how shall we manage it with
our family of four children?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have fixed all that," her husband
answered. "We are to stay with your cousin
Lola in the city. She will keep us through
the week for a small sum, as she says she has
an extra room that she will be glad to have
us use.</p>

<p>"So get ready, wife, and look as fine as possible
in your new blue skirt and the red bodice
below the white blouse. Do not forget to
wear the fringed kerchief on your pretty head.
It is the one I gave you when you were a gay
young girl."</p>

<p>His wife promised to make herself look as
fine as possible, as she blushed more deeply
than ever.</p>

<p>The carnival! The carnival! Is it any
wonder that Tessa and her brother slept but
little that night, and that when they did, they
dreamed of processions and bonbons and
clowns and flower-decked wagons and all sorts
of strange sights?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Their father hired a donkey from one of
his neighbours for Tessa and Francesca to ride
on. Pietro was to carry their mother and
the baby.</p>

<p>When at last they were ready to start, they
were a merry sight. Beppo and Tessa had
gathered quantities of wild flowers to use at
the carnival, so that Tessa and her mother
looked as though they were in the middle of
travelling gardens.</p>

<p>"If these give out," Beppo had told his
sister, "we can go over to the Coliseum and
get wallflowers and some other pretty blossoms
that grow in the crevices of the walls.
They must be in bloom by this time. We
must throw many a bouquet to Lucy and her
brother."</p>

<p>The city looked bright and gay as the peasant
and his family drew near. The streets
were filled with carriages; the sidewalks were
lined with people; while the houses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
decked with bright-coloured carpets, mats, and
all sorts of hangings.</p>

<p>Merry parties had already seated themselves
in the balconies, for it was one o'clock on the
first day of the carnival.</p>

<p>What does this word "carnival" mean?
you ask. It is another name for "farewell
to meat," and the great festival of Italy is
always held during the week before the beginning
of Lent. All the days except Sunday
and Friday are given up to merrymaking,
which grows more and more lively until
the last night.</p>

<p>The children go to bed and get up whenever
they like. There is no scolding, no cross
word; and even if the sport becomes very
rough, every one takes it with good nature.</p>

<p>Tessa and Beppo went with the rest of the
family to their cousin's home on the ground
floor of a tall stone building. But they rested
only a few moments.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take the donkeys, children, and ride off
to see the sights," said their father. "Your
mother and I will stay and talk with our
friends awhile before we go out."</p>

<p>They did not need to be told twice, and
were soon in the midst of a merry crowd on
the Corso, as one of the principal streets of
Rome is called.</p>

<p>"Look, look, Beppo," said Tessa. "Do
see that wagon full of clowns and queerly
dressed people. They are having great sport.
They are pelting every one with confetti. We
shall get hit if we don't take care."</p>

<p>"We'll get some confetti ourselves," answered
Beppo. "We must not wait any
longer."</p>

<p>The two children stopped their donkeys
in front of a stand covered with tiny lime-balls.
Perhaps you would call them plaster
candies. They were no larger than peas,
and looked nice enough to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>"Now for fun," said Beppo, when each had
purchased a big bag of confetti.</p>

<p>At this moment, some boys, who were close
behind, gave Pietro's tail a sudden pull and
Tessa fell forward as he jumped about. Before
she could get up, she felt a shower of confetti
falling over her neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>A loud laugh went up from the bystanders.
Tessa laughed, too, as she brushed the powdery
balls to right and left.</p>

<p>A moment after, another shower came falling
about her. But this time it was made of
sugar almonds, which a little girl was scattering
from a balcony. She must have liked Tessa's
pretty face and wished to give her a treat.</p>

<p>There was a great scrambling for the candy.
The mischievous boys who had thrown the
confetti got most of it, I fear, but Tessa
enjoyed it, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Look at the lovely carriage ahead of us,"
she cried. "It is lined with white. Aren't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the ladies in it pretty, Beppo? That seat in
front of them is just loaded with bouquets and
confetti. They are standing up now to throw
better."</p>

<p>Beppo didn't care for this half as much as
for the wagon-loads of people dressed in bright
colours and wearing masks.</p>

<p>"Look at that man, Tessa, before he is out
of sight. Yes, it must be a man, though he
is dressed like a woman. See his false curls
hanging down under the bonnet, and hear him
talk. He keeps every one around him laughing.
Let's put on our masks and then ride
past Lucy's house. She won't know us if she
sees us."</p>

<p>Beppo had made some rude masks before
the children left home. After they had
put them on, they felt sure no one would
know them as they rode through the lively
crowd.</p>

<p>"Look up at the second balcony," whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Tessa, as she came up close to her
brother's side. "There are Lucy and Arthur
with their father and mother, in the midst of a
merry party. We might have known they
would be here on the Corso."</p>

<p>"Do you see what Arthur is doing?"
replied Beppo. "He has a bouquet of
flowers fastened to the end of a long string.
And now he is dangling it over the rail.
Just see that lady in the balcony below
reaching out to get it. She thinks it is being
thrown to her. How surprised she is when
it comes up again out of her reach. Oh,
what sport!</p>

<p>"But watch, Tessa. I am going to throw
my prettiest bunch of flowers to Lucy. Ah!
she looks like an angel to-day. She is all
in white."</p>

<p>Beppo took a bouquet of roses and tossed
them straight up into his little friend's lap.
She was looking directly toward him as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
threw them. She began to laugh, and, lifting
them in her hands, turned to her father and
said something.</p>

<p>"She is asking him who we are," said
Beppo. "She will never guess, for she does
not expect to see us at the carnival."</p>

<p>Tessa and her brother now moved onward,
but not before they were covered with a
shower of candy. It was Lucy's return for
her flowers.</p>

<p>A little before sunset the two country children
went back to their cousin's. They found
their father and mother all ready to go out to
see the races.</p>

<p>"What an odd-looking child you are,
Tessa. And you, too, Beppo," said their
mother. For they were fairly covered with
white dust.</p>

<p>"Never mind," laughed Beppo. "You
will look like that to-morrow, mother, if you
stay outdoors long enough. I really think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that hundreds of bushels of confetti have been
thrown about the streets to-day. We have
received our share of them, without doubt."</p>

<p>"Come, come, not a moment to lose now,"
said the father, "or we shall be too late to see
the sport."</p>

<p>The good-natured cousin said she would
look after the baby, while Francesca rode off
down the street on her father's shoulder.
The donkeys had been put in the stable for
their night's rest.</p>

<p>The party soon reached the Corso, which
had been cleared of carriages. Both sides were
lined by an ever-growing crowd.</p>

<p>Just at sunset a gun was fired. Instantly a
number of beautiful horses were freed. They
wore fine trappings and were without riders or
drivers. Down the Corso they raced from one
end to the other. It seemed as though they
passed by like lightning.</p>

<p>"Good, good," shouted Beppo, as the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
horse reached the goal. This one was the
winner of the race, of course.</p>

<p>"We can see this sport every night of the carnival,"
his father told him, as they walked slowly
homeward, looking at the sights on the way.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Tessa and Beppo
started off on their donkeys once more. They
did not wish to lose a moment of the day's
fun. They had many a mock battle with the
children whom they met, but the fighting was
all good-natured, and the only weapons used
were handfuls of confetti.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they found themselves near
Arthur and Lucy, who were in an open carriage.
They did not have their masks on, so
their friends spied them out very quickly.
They were very glad to see each other, but the
crowd was so great they did not have a chance
to say much.</p>

<p>"Tessa," whispered Lucy, "father has
something to ask your parents. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
going to write to them if he did not see them
before the end of the carnival. Be sure to
tell them. It is about you."</p>

<p>That was all she had a chance to say before
the driver started up the horses and she had
passed on. Tessa wondered what it could be
about, but her mind was soon busy with the
gay sights, and she forgot all about it till she
reached home.</p>

<p>The last night of the carnival was the gayest
time of all. As soon as it was dark, Tessa
went with her father and mother and Beppo
out into the streets. Every one carried a torch
and tried to keep it lighted. At the same time
he must try to put out as many other torches
as possible.</p>

<p>How the lights danced up and down the
streets! What a puffing and blowing there
was all the time. Tessa no sooner got her
torch lighted than some one came up from
behind and put it out. Then she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
cry, "Senza moccolo, senza moccolo." That
means, "Without light, without light."</p>

<p>After a while, Beppo fastened his torch to
the end of a long pole. He thought he was
safe at last. But, no! a moment afterward
some one came along with a pole longer than
his own and dashed it down. The fun was
all the greater for such little things as this.</p>

<p>The city looked wonderfully pretty with
the lights dancing about the windows and
balconies and streets.</p>

<p>After an hour or two the crowds began to
thin out. Every one was tired. Tessa and
Beppo turned homeward with their father
and mother, calling out:</p>

<p>"The carnival is dead. The carnival is
dead."</p>

<p>Soon afterward they tumbled into bed, half
asleep, still repeating the words they heard
echoing through the streets:</p>

<p>"The carnival is dead!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BURIED CITY</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">We</span> should like to take your little daughter
with us on a journey," said Mr. Gray to
Tessa's father.</p>

<p>The two men were standing in the doorway
of the artist's home on the Monday after the
carnival. Tessa had not forgotten to tell her
father that Mr. Gray wished to see him.</p>

<p>"We shall be gone only a few days. We
are going to take a short trip to Naples," the
artist went on. "But Lucy wishes Tessa's
company very much, and I think your little
girl would enjoy it. What do you say?"</p>

<p>The peasant was greatly pleased. His face
beamed, as he replied:</p>

<p>"You are a good friend to us, Mr. Gray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
We can never forget it. What shall we do
when you go back to America?"</p>

<p>"That time will not come for two years yet.
In the meanwhile, talk with your wife. If she
is willing, bring Tessa here Tuesday morning.
We shall leave on the afternoon of that day."</p>

<p>You can imagine how excited our little
Italian cousin was, when she found herself
riding on a train for the first time. The cars
were much smaller than we use here in America.
It would have seemed odd to you to
have the conductor (or the guard, as he is
called in Europe) lock the doors when the
train is about to start.</p>

<p>"We are prisoners," laughed Lucy. "We
can't get out now, even if we should wish to
do so ever so much."</p>

<p>She was now able to chatter in Italian almost
as fast as in her own English tongue.</p>

<p>"That is because of her acquaintance with
Tessa and her brother," Mr. Gray told his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
wife. "Those children surprise me by the
good Italian they speak, when they have had
so little schooling. Although their parents are
peasants, they are gentle people in their nature.
And that is more than learning, after all."</p>

<p>The children were delighted with Naples.
The city rests on the shore of what some
people consider the most beautiful bay in
the world. Everything about it looked clean
and orderly, although a few years ago it was
a very filthy city.</p>

<p>No one seemed in a hurry. Even the
beggars, who came to meet the children with
hands stretched out for alms, looked lazy and
happy.</p>

<p>There were beautiful gardens to walk in, and
fine buildings to visit, besides rowing and sailing
on the blue waters of the bay. There was
plenty to see, but best of all was the morning
the children spent in the museum, where there
was a large collection of curiosities.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"They all came from the buried city," Mr.
Gray explained.</p>

<p>"Think of it, children! These beautiful
ornaments, vases, and bronzes, were hidden
under the ashes for eighteen hundred years.
One day it was discovered by some workman
that he was digging into the ruins of a building.
Others came to help him, and by and
by they found a city beneath the ashes and
soil which had formed above it."</p>

<p>"You are going to take us to see the city
before we go back to Rome, aren't you,
father?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"Certainly; I would not have you miss the
sight for a good deal. But does Tessa know
its name?"</p>

<p>"O yes, it is Pompeii. I have heard much
about it," the little Italian answered. "It is
another of the wonderful sights in my country
of which I am so proud."</p>

<p>The children passed slowly from one part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the museum to another. They examined the
almonds, dates, and figs, which had been preserved
so long. Some of them looked quite
natural. There was a lady's toilet set that interested
the girls very much.</p>

<p>There were blackened loaves of bread and
cake from the baker's oven; there were beautiful
lamps and golden jewelry,&mdash;all these
things made for people suddenly overtaken by
death nearly two thousand years ago!</p>

<p>It was hard to leave the museum.</p>

<p>"But there are other things to see yet, and
we cannot spend too much time in one place,"
Mr. Gray told them as they walked homeward.</p>

<p>They stopped to buy some luscious yellow
oranges and some ornaments of coral and lava
at stands by the side of the street.</p>

<p>That very evening ponies were brought to
the hotel door, and the party started out to
climb the side of Vesuvius.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shouldn't think the people of Naples
would feel safe to live so near a volcano," said
Lucy. "Now that it is active again, it must
make them think of the way Pompeii was
destroyed. And Pompeii is several miles
away, isn't it, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there was no more thought of danger
at that time than we feel to-night. Perhaps
not so much," he added, as he looked toward
his wife.</p>

<p>She was a little pale and was feeling more
timid than she liked to say. Up above them,
even now, they could see the sky lighted up
by the red flame. It looked as though a city
must be on fire. The path wound in a roundabout
way, but was always rising and was in
some places very steep and rocky.</p>

<p>"See that red stream of lava pouring down
the side of the mountain," said Arthur.</p>

<p>It was not so far away but that the children
could see men at work beside it. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
scooping the lava up into vessels. It would
be taken down to Naples and made into
jewelry and ornaments to be sold to visitors
in the city.</p>

<p>After two miles or more of hard climbing,
they reached the side of the crater.</p>

<p>"Don't go too near. Oh, do be careful,
children," cried Mrs. Gray. She was trembling
as she looked at the red-hot stones flying
upward in the midst of the cinders and flames.</p>

<p>"Listen, do listen, mother. It is grand!"
said Lucy, as they could now hear the roaring
and grumbling, the pounding and hammering
under ground. It was as though some terrible
being was an angry prisoner in the volcano and
was trying to free himself.</p>

<p>Tessa clung to Mrs. Gray's skirt at first.
She was frightened, too, and it was no wonder.
But after a few moments both she and her
kind friend had got over their fright and had
begun to enjoy the strange sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/i139.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="ruins" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT WAS A STRANGE PLACE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>When at last Mrs. Gray said it was time to
go, they all felt sorry.</p>

<p>The drive down the mountain was quite
easy. When they reached the hotel the children
went straight to bed to dream of the
pleasure to-morrow,&mdash;for they were to visit
the buried city, Pompeii.</p>

<p>The next day was bright and clear.
Although every one felt a little tired after the
excitement of the night before, they were all
ready for the day's trip.</p>

<p>It was a strange place, this city with no one
living in it. There were streets all laid out
and the walls of houses standing. The roofs
were gone, however.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray explained to the children that the
city was buried under the terrible shower of
ashes which settled down over it. The roofs
had been burnt or broken down by the weight
above them. After a while, soil formed above
the ashes, grass began to grow, and the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the world forgot about the city, once so beautiful,
with its stately palaces and grand buildings.</p>



<p>Most of the people had time to flee before
their homes were destroyed. But some of
them stayed too long. Their skeletons were
found when the city was unearthed.</p>

<p>The children went into a cellar where there
were marks on the walls. The guide told them
that these showed where people were pressed
against them. They must have fled to that
place for safety, but it had been of no use.
They stood here prisoners until kind death
freed them from their suffering.</p>

<p>They saw many marble ornaments. There
were ducks and geese, rabbits and lambs, made
long ago.</p>

<p>"All this makes me feel queer, Lucy,"
whispered Tessa. "I will be glad to get back
to a <i>live</i> city again." Lucy felt so, too. It
was interesting, of course, but it was very
strange.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>After the visit to Pompeii, Mr. Gray told
the children that his vacation was over and
they must all go back to Rome.</p>

<p>"But we will not return by train," he said.
"We will take a sailing vessel, as I think you
will enjoy a trip on the water."</p>

<p>They did enjoy it greatly. The only
trouble was that it seemed too short.</p>

<p>"When June comes it will be quite hot in
Rome, you know," Lucy said to Tessa. The
two girls were in the bow of the boat, looking
over the edge into the water below.</p>

<p>"We are going then on a journey to the
north of Italy, and you are to come, too,
Tessa. Father says so. We will visit Venice
and sail in boats through its streets. It seems
as though I could hardly wait for the time
to come. Just think of a great city built
on little islands, and when you go to the door
of your house you find yourself on the water's
edge. It must be lovely."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tessa," she went on, putting her arm
around the little Italian's waist, "father says
that he is going to manage next winter so that
you shall stay with us and we can have lessons
together with my governess."</p>

<p>Tessa bent forward and kissed both of
Lucy's hands. She was so happy she could
not speak.</p>
